There's a whole lot of women in me
You're wondering what I mean, I see
Meet the Good, the Bad and the Crazy
I come in many shades and shapes
So don't put up the barricades
I'm not here to make a war
But I get crazy sometimes
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
Nothing can bring me down
Or keep me sound
I won't get home on time
